The week mainly focuses on utilizing Google Earth Engine (GEE) for remote sensing data processing, covering key functions such as image filtering, NDVI computation, mosaicking, and spatial analysis for urban and environmental applications.

## Summary

In this week's lecture, we explored Google Earth Engine (GEE) and its application in processing remote sensing data. GEE is a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform that allows large-scale processing of satellite imagery.

Key topics covered in the session included:

-   Loading and filtering satellite imagery using Landsat 9 surface reflectance data.
-   Computing indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to assess vegetation health.
-   Mosaicking and clipping images to refine analysis within specific study areas.
-   Exporting processed images to Google Drive for further analysis.

Below is an example of computing NDVI in GEE:

``` javascript
// Load Landsat 9 imagery and filter by date
var dataset = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2')
    .filterDate('2022-01-01', '2022-02-01');

// Compute NDVI using NIR (Band 5) and Red (Band 4)
var ndvi = dataset.first().normalizedDifference(['SR_B5', 'SR_B4']).rename('NDVI');

// Display NDVI layer with color visualization
Map.addLayer(ndvi, {min: 0, max: 1, palette: ['blue', 'white', 'green']}, 'NDVI');
```

This lecture reinforced the importance of cloud computing in geospatial analysis, making it possible to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Applications

GEE plays a crucial role in urban studies, environmental monitoring, and policy analysis, offering scalable solutions for spatial data processing. It is widely used in land-use classification, climate change research, and urban heat island analysis.

For example, research by Gorelick et al. (2017) highlights GEE’s capability in multi-temporal analysis of land cover changes, enabling researchers to assess urban expansion over time. Similarly, Gong et al. (2019) utilized GEE for global land cover mapping, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale remote sensing applications.

In the policy domain, GEE is instrumental in monitoring deforestation and urban sprawl, assisting government agencies in spatial planning and disaster management (Hansen et al., 2013). By integrating socio-economic datasets, GEE can also help in analyzing transport accessibility and social inequalities, making it a valuable tool in urban planning and mobility studies.

## Reflection

This week was my first introduction to Google Earth Engine (GEE), and it’s been an exciting start to exploring how cloud-based platforms can transform remote sensing analysis. GEE’s ability to process large-scale satellite imagery efficiently is impressive, and it’s truly fascinating that it allows for analysis at a global scale while also enabling a zoomed-in focus on specific countries or regions. As a beginner, I found it easy to filter and visualize Landsat data, and the speed of processing was a big advantage compared to traditional methods. The hands-on approach of working directly with satellite imagery, like computing NDVI to analyze vegetation health, was a valuable learning experience.

However, as much as I’m amazed by GEE’s power, this week also made me reflect critically on the limitations of remote sensing. For instance, the example involving famine highlighted an important lesson: while satellite data can provide valuable insights, it can’t tell the whole story. Remote sensing is often most effective when combined with other contextual data, such as socioeconomic or local environmental information. This reinforces the point that while tools like GEE are powerful, they need to be used thoughtfully and in combination with other data sources to ensure that conclusions are meaningful and useful for decision-making.

I also realized that, although GEE streamlines complex processes like mosaicking and clipping, working with satellite imagery still requires careful attention to detail. There are steps, such as atmospheric corrections, that need to be carefully considered to ensure data accuracy. This session has reinforced the idea that tools like GEE are incredibly useful, but they also require critical thinking and domain knowledge to interpret the results properly.

In the future, I look forward to diving deeper into GEE and learning how to leverage its capabilities for more complex urban and environmental studies. The experience has opened my eyes to the potential of cloud-based geospatial tools, and I’m excited to apply them in my research.
