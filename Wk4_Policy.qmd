# 4 Policy

Week 4 focused on the applications of remote sensing to policy, and I
made a case study in Singapore.

## 4.1 Summary

### 4.1.1 City Summary

Singapore is a highly urbanized city-state located at the southern tip
of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With a land area of just 728
km² and a population of 5.9 million, Singapore is one of the world's
most densely populated countries. The nation faces unique challenges due
to its limited land resources, including food security concerns as it
imports over 90% of its food supply, vulnerability to climate change
effects like sea-level rise, and urban heat island intensification due
to its dense urban development.

### 4.1.2 Policy Summary

1.  **Global Policy Overview**:

    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Singapore has committed to
    implementing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), with particular emphasis on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and
    Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). As a highly urbanized
    nation with limited natural resources, Singapore has prioritized
    creating a sustainable, resilient urban environment.

2.  **Singapore Green Plan 2030** (Singapore Ministry of Sustainability
    and the Environment, 2021)

    The Singapore Green Plan 2030, launched by the government in 2021,
    serves as a national roadmap toward sustainable development and
    net-zero emissions. The plan integrates remote sensing technology to
    monitor environmental changes, track policy implementation, and
    evaluate effectiveness across various domains. Singapore's Urban
    Redevelopment Authority (URA) and National Environment Agency (NEA)
    have partnered with research institutions to employ Earth
    observation data for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
    climate adaptation. This partnership leverages remote sensing to map
    urban heat islands, monitor green space development, and assess
    coastal changes to inform policy decisions and future planning.

    | Goal                         | Target                                                                |
    |-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
    | Increasing urban green cover | From **47% to 50%** by 2030                                           |
    | Green spaces and trees       | **1,000 hectares** of green spaces, **one million additional trees**  |
    | Local food production        | **20%** of Singapore's total food demand by 2030                      |
    | Waste reduction              | **30%** reduction in waste sent to landfill by 2030                   |
    | Solar energy expansion       | **8,000 hectares** of solar panels on rooftops and reservoirs by 2030 |
    | Climate resilience           | Strategies against **sea-level rise and extreme weather events**      |
    | Water resource management    | Sustainable management through **catchment management**               |

## 4.2 Application

This section identifies how remotely sensed data could be used to
contribute to Singapore's policy goals, answering the question: **'How
could the data be applied to solve the policy challenge?'**

### 4.2.1 Data Sources

Singapore employs multiple remote sensing platforms to support its Green
Plan implementation:

-   **Satellite Imagery:**
    -   **Sentinel-2**: Provides 10m resolution multispectral data to
        monitor urban vegetation changes.
    -   **Landsat data**: Offers a historical perspective for long-term
        change analysis.
    -   **Thermal Mapping**:
        -   Landsat 8/9 thermal bands and ECOSTRESS data identify urban
            heat islands.
        -   Temperature readings are accurate to within 1°C.
-   **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs):**
    -   Provides ultra-high resolution (sub-meter) imagery.
    -   Used for monitoring specific urban projects, tree health in
        parks, and rooftop gardens.
-   **Aerial LiDAR Surveys:**
    -   Creates detailed 3D models of the urban environment.
    -   Essential for vegetation structure analysis and building-level
        energy studies.

### 4.2.2 Techniques

-   **Urban Heat Island Monitoring**

1.  Acquire thermal infrared imagery from satellites and aerial
    platforms.
2.  Calibrate and correct imagery for atmospheric effects.
3.  Generate surface temperature maps across the urban area.
4.  Identify heat island hotspots and correlate with urban features.
5.  Track temperature changes in relation to green infrastructure
    implementation.
6.  Develop targeted cooling strategies for hotspot areas.

-   **Green Space Assessment**

1.  Acquire high-resolution multispectral imagery.
2.  Calculate vegetation indices (**NDVI, EVI**) to quantify greenery.
3.  Classify urban vegetation types (**tree canopy, shrubs, grass**).
4.  Monitor changes in green cover over time.
5.  Evaluate effectiveness of tree-planting initiatives.
6.  Identify priority areas for new green space development.

-   **Coastal Change Monitoring**

2.  Use **SAR imagery** for high-precision elevation measurements.
3.  Detect changes in shoreline position and elevation.
4.  Monitor effectiveness of coastal protection measures.
5.  Model areas vulnerable to sea-level rise.
6.  Develop adaptive strategies for coastal infrastructure.

1.  Identify existing and potential rooftop farming locations.
2.  Monitor productivity of urban farms with multispectral imagery.
3.  Calculate potential food production capacity across the city.
4.  Track progress toward **30% local food production goal**.
5.  Optimize urban farming techniques based on remote sensing data.

## 4.3 Reflection

Singapore's application of remote sensing technologies to support its
Green Plan 2030 demonstrates how a land-constrained city-state can
leverage Earth observation data to inform sustainable development
policies. The integration of satellite, aerial, and UAV platforms
provides multi-scale monitoring capabilities that match the precision
requirements of Singapore's urban planning and environmental management
needs.

What I find most interesting about Singapore's approach is how necessity
has driven innovation. With extremely limited land resources and high
vulnerability to climate change, Singapore cannot afford planning
mistakes or ineffective environmental policies. Remote sensing provides
the evidence base needed to optimize every square meter of the urban
landscape for multiple benefits – from cooling effects to food
production to biodiversity support.

Singapore's coastal monitoring is particularly critical given that
approximately 30% of the island lies less than 5 meters above sea level.
The combination of satellite-based monitoring and detailed elevation
modeling enables planners to prioritize adaptation measures where
they're most needed, potentially saving billions in infrastructure costs
through targeted interventions.

The city-state's approach to urban heat island mitigation could serve as
a model for other tropical cities. By systematically mapping surface
temperatures against urban morphology and vegetation cover, Singapore
has developed precise guidelines for how much and what type of urban
greenery is needed to achieve specific cooling targets. This data-driven
approach to climate adaptation could be valuable across Southeast Asia,
where many megacities face similar heat challenges. An output of
Singapore's urban greening policy can be seen in Figure, showing the
integration of vegetation into high-density urban areas through
innovative vertical gardens.
