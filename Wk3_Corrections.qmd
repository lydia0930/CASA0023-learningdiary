## Summary

In this lecture, I learned about the fundamentals of remote sensing,
focusing on data acquisition, sensor technologies, data processing, and
their applications in urban and environmental studies. The session was
divided into two main parts: image correction and data mosaicing and
enhancement. Below are the key takeaways:

### Sensor Types and Mechanisms

Remote sensing sensors are at the core of remote sensing technology, and
different types of sensors employ different imaging mechanisms. The
following table compares two common types of sensors:

| Sensor Type                       | Working Principle                                                                     | Pros & Cons                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Whisk broom (cross-track scanner) | Uses a rotating mirror to reflect light onto a single detector, covering a large area | Wide coverage, but moving parts can wear out      |
| Push broom (along-track scanner)  | Uses detector arrays for faster and more efficient imaging                            | High efficiency, but requires precise calibration |
| MSS (Multispectral Scanner)       | Uses a digital approach to capture multispectral data (visible + near-infrared)       | Provides better data continuity and accuracy      |

Through these different sensor technologies, remote sensing systems are
able to capture various types of land feature data based on specific
needs.

### Data Correction Process

Satellite imagery often requires correction before it can be used for
analysis. The following diagram shows the typical correction process:

-   Start with a Raw Satellite Image.

-   Perform Geometric Correction to fix distortions caused by sensor
    motion or the Earth's curvature.

-   Apply Atmospheric Correction to remove haze or scattering effects,
    for example, using dark object subtraction.

-   Proceed with Terrain Correction to adjust for elevation differences,
    such as through orthorectification.

Data correction is a crucial first step to ensure the accuracy and
usability of remote sensing imagery. By applying geometric correction,
atmospheric correction, and terrain correction, we can eliminate
external disturbances and improve the precision of the data.

### Data Mosaicing and Enhancement

Mosaicing and enhancement techniques are vital for improving remote
sensing imagery, especially for urban and environmental studies.
However, these techniques must be chosen based on the specific needs of
the study. Standard mosaicing methods may not always be suitable for
satellite imagery, as there can be discrepancies in lighting and
radiometric calibration between images.

| Enhancement Method        | Description                                      | Challenges in Urban Applications                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Mosaicing**             | Combines multiple images into one seamless image | Standard methods may cause radiometric inconsistencies |
| **Contrast Enhancement**  | Improves clarity by enhancing feature contrast   | May over-complicate images, hindering research         |
| **Creating New Datasets** | Uses band composition/feature extraction         | High computational load and analysis complexity        |

These enhancement methods can improve image contrast and clarity,
helping to analyze land cover changes more effectively. However, whether
added complexity truly benefits the research objectives needs careful
consideration.

## Applications

Landsat satellites, providing over 50 years of Earth observation data
since 1972, have had a profound impact on monitoring urban growth,
deforestation, temperature changes, and more.

### Urban Growth & Land Use Mapping

One of the most powerful applications of remote sensing is its ability
to monitor urban growth and land use changes over time. Satellites like
Landsat and Sentinel-2 have been invaluable in tracking the
transformation of landscapes, especially as urban areas expand. The
integration of Landsat with other datasets, like Sentinel-2 through the
Dynamic World project, enables near-real-time land cover mapping, which
is crucial for monitoring urbanization, deforestation, and the spread of
infrastructure. For example, through the combination of these datasets,
researchers can track the extent of urban sprawl, assess changes in
built-up areas, and even identify shifts in the types of land cover
(e.g., from agriculture to residential). This kind of information is
vital for city planners and policymakers in managing sustainable urban
growth and mitigating the environmental impact of development.
Additionally, urban heat islands, a key environmental concern in cities,
can be monitored using thermal infrared data, which helps identify
regions that are overheating due to dense urbanization and limited
vegetation.

### Environmental Monitoring & Disaster Response

Remote sensing also plays a critical role in environmental monitoring,
particularly in disaster response and management. Landsat and Sentinel-2
satellites have been used extensively to monitor wildfires, floods, and
changes in ecosystems. For example, Landsatâ€™s long-term data series
allows for the analysis of wildfire spread and recovery over decades.
These data sets provide valuable insights into the impact of fire on
vegetation and soil, and how these ecosystems recover over time.
Similarly, Sentinel-2's high temporal resolution makes it an excellent
tool for monitoring environmental changes more frequently, such as
detecting the early stages of flooding or tracking the aftermath ofS
extreme weather events. Remote sensing also supports vegetation health
monitoring by detecting anomalies in plant reflectance, particularly
using the near-infrared spectrum, which is sensitive to plant stress.
This capability is essential for agriculture, forestry, and conservation
efforts, enabling early intervention when vegetation shows signs of
degradation, drought, or pest infestations.

## Reflection

This week's atmospheric correction exercise was a real eye-opener for me. Getting my hands dirty with actual remote sensing data made me appreciate how much work goes into preparing images before we can even start analyzing them. I tried both the basic Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method and the more sophisticated 6S model, and the experience really drove home how researchers constantly have to weigh accuracy against what's practical.

The most striking moment came when I compared my corrected NDVI values with actual ground measurements. While DOS definitely improved my results compared to raw data, I was surprised by how much it struggled in urban areas - turns out finding truly "dark" pixels in a city is way harder than I thought. This really made me realize how location-specific these correction methods can be. A technique that works great for forests might completely miss the mark downtown.

It got me thinking about all the research papers I've read - how many of their findings might be influenced by these preprocessing choices that often get just a brief mention in the methods section? The exercise showed me that what seems like a small technical decision (which correction method to use) could actually sway conclusions about things like urban heat or vegetation health.

I also came away with more sympathy for why researchers sometimes choose simpler methods. Before this, I might have wondered why anyone wouldn't always use the most advanced technique available. But after wrestling with the 6S model's complex requirements and long processing times, I totally get it now - sometimes good enough really is good enough, especially when you're working with limited time or resources.

At the end of the day, I've learned that while data correction is crucial for getting reliable results, more complex doesn't always mean better. It's all about matching the method to your specific needs and being transparent about the limitations. This practical experience has definitely changed how I'll approach remote sensing data in the future - more critical thinking about the methods.
